						In terms of how I do my research, 
						<br><br>						
						I spend a lot of time designing and building things  
						<br><br>
						I've alternated between visualization and interface design at various levels of fidelity, 
						<br><br>
						as well as software development for a deployed product, a research toolkit, and various visualization tools and experimental applications. 
						<br><br>
						Though just as important are the human-centred research methods that I use,
						<br><br>
						This includes quite a bit of qualitative evaluation work during my PhD in the context of visualization design or case studies,
						<br><br>
						Which involved everything from requirements analysis to analyzing the usage of deployed visualization tools.
						<br><br>
						This qualitative work also involves systematically collecting and categorized previous research as well as information design content done by practitioners.
						<br><br>
						And finally I also do lab-based experimental work, and especially recently with some experiments involving crowdsourcing,
						<br><br>
						I'll revisit some of these methods later in this talk when I speak about evaluating interactive visualization tools.

						<aside class="notes">
							With respect to tasks, a central theme of my PhD research pertained to classifying visualization tasks and to consolidating the vocabulary for visualization tasks into a typology,
							<br><br>
							Which is the subject of a 2013 paper written with my PhD advisor Tamara Munzner.
							<br><br>
							And expressive information design requires being able to address a wide range of tasks,

							Including both the tasks of an information designer or author, as well as the tasks of a viewer, or what the audience is expected to do with the information presented to them. 
							<br><br>
							Such as to identify a trend or to compare values.
							<br><br>
							Ultimately, expressivity is about satisfying the intent of the author, allowing them to tell the story they want to tell,
							<br><br>
							And whether this story can be reconstructed in the mind of the viewer.

					<!-- VALUE OF ENABLING INFORMATION DESIGN ================================================== -->

						<h4>Goal: <span style="color:gold">Enabling</span> Information Visualization</h4>

							How can I enable people to... <br><br><br><br>
							Expressively <strong>visualize</strong> their data? <br><br>
							<strong>Produce</strong> and <strong>present</strong> compelling data-driven stories? <br><br>

							Applications of visualization <strong>beyond</strong> those in <strong>professional data analysis</strong>.
						</small>

						<aside class="notes">
						With respect to the values and goals that underlie my research,
						<br><br>
						I'm really hoping to enable more people to visualize and present compelling stories about their data, 
						<br><br>
						And its in this respect that I contrast my research from that of many others in the broader visualization community, such as those working in visual analytics. 
						<br><br>
						Many in the visualization and visual analytics research community are motivated by use cases from professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. 
						<br><br> 
						While I think these use cases are important and I'm glad that people are thinking about them, they are <em>NOT</em> the use cases that motivate my research. 
						<br><br>
						Instead, I'm interested in incorporating visualization to present information to people who don't identify as data analysts, in both public and personal contexts.
						<br><br>
						So I often think of news readers, students, policy makers, and citizens who consume visual displays of information and visual explanations.

					<!-- VALUE OF CONNECTING RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ================================================== -->

						<small style="text-align:left">
							Disseminating visualization <strong>research</strong> into <strong>practice</strong>, and <strong>vice</strong> <strong>versa</strong>.

							<br><br>
							<strong>Collecting examples</strong> of information design <strong>produced by practitioners</strong> (e.g., news graphics designers).
							<br><br><br><br>
							<strong>Fostering</strong> a <strong>dialogue</strong> between <strong>researchers</strong> and <strong>practitioners</strong> (e.g., <a style="color:skyblue" href="https://openvisconf.com" target="_blank">OpenVisConf</a>, <a style="color:skyblue" href="https://visinpractice.github.io" target="_blank">VisInPractice</a>)*.

						<aside class="notes">
						Finally, increasing expressivity and democratizing visualization are only possible if there is an ongoing process of communication and outreach between visualization researchers and practitioners.

						As you'll see in my own research, this manifests as studying the adoption of deployed tools and prototypes.
						<br><br>
						And collecting examples of information design produced by practitioners.
						<br><br> 
						And finally this means speaking directly with practitioners, such as when I spoke at OpenVisConf, one of the most renowned practitioner-oriented visualization conferences, 
						<br><br>
						Or how I co-organized the VisInPractice event at last year's IEEE VIS conference, where I invited prominent visualization practitioners to speak to a largely academic audience.

						<aside class="notes">
							To illustrate this, I want to tell you a few interesting things about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and other creative types.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had wondered if there was any pattern as to when creative people do their  creative work.
							<br><br>It turns out that at least among these people, some creative people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have odd ones like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had also wondered about the potential relationship between sleep and creativity, so let me focus your attention to these blue arcs.
							<br><br>Most people here tend to sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>A third question I had was about variation and creativity. Let me show you how often these creative people change activities throughout their day.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This 24-hour clock metaphoe isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so I'm going to transition to a just show you a sequence of activities without any duration, effectively resulting in a radial bar chart. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To show who varied the most and least among these people, a linear representation is probably better, where you can see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people here while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, I'll restore the duration of events so that you can compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, where you might spot times where some routines appear to be in sync with one another, such as when people work or sleep at the same time.
							<br><br>And this is a good time to ask you to compare your own daily rhythm to these creative people.
							<br><br>When do you sleep, eat, or do you best creative work?

							<br><br> 
							I did so upon realizing that prior visualization research involving timelines had focused on their uses in data analysis, such as for understanding patterns in electronic health records.
							<br><br>
							And because of this focus, the expressive range of design choices considered by the research community was far smaller than the range of design choices considered by the design and practice community.

							It turns out that there are many ways to answer these questions and present timelines, which brings me to my design space. 
							<br><br>
							You can represent time in various ways, such as linearly, radially, or by using spirals, grids such as calendars, or along a curve 
							<br><br>
							And you can combine these representations with different time scales: you could use an absolute or relative chronological scale, a logarithmic scale, or a purely sequential scale.
							<br><br>
							And then there's "Layout", or how to draw one or more timelines within a page or display: 
							<br><br>This has to do with deciding between a single timeline, faceting into multiple timelines (like how I did for each creative person), 
							<br><br>Or wrapping a single timeline into meaningful segments of time, like a decade or a century.

								Provide <strong>alternative</strong> time <strong>scales</strong>.<br><br>
								Anticipate <strong>chronological</strong> or <strong>non-chronological</strong> narratives.<br><br>
								Incrementally <strong>reveal</strong> visual elements, selectively <strong>highlighting</strong> and <strong>annotating</strong> to direct attention.
							</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							In this TVCG paper I make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							I should also emphasize that existing timeline tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: 
							<br><br>
							Either the whole timeline is shown as a static image, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order, one event at a time as a series of slides.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,
							<br><br>
							Like how in my story about the routines of creative people, I revealed and highlighted aspects of those timelines in an order that wasn't chronological starting at midnight. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, you should make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

							In summary, Timeline Storyteller fills a gap in that no existing tool allows a non-programmer to present a visually expressive timeline narrative.
							<br><br>
							It's really the first to incorporate this animated multi-scene PowerPoint-like story format along with multiple visual representation choices;
							<br><br>
							And I believe that many aspects of its design can be applied to other forms of data, such as its ability to incrementally reveal and selectively highlight content.
							<br><br>
							We're still learning about how it's being used in the wild,

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed stats including confidence intervals and effect sizes for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							In general, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't seem to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when identifying values or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							It's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.
							<br><br>
							Altogether these findings are interesting given the popularity of radial representations of time in practice and design communities.

							As for conclusions, the questions of which representation and which granularity to display are really questions about congruence between these design choices and the combinaation of data and task.

							Whether the task is about locating values or comparing them,

							My hope for this work was to inspire the visualization research community to consider the future of Information design choices on mobile devices as well as the potential research questions that can be asked via crowdsourced experimentation,
							<br><br>
							And to this end I open-sourced my experimental application and the data analysis code so that others could run similar experiments on mobile phones, 
							<br><br>
							though substituting different data and chart types.
							<br><br>
							I also contributed a post to the Multiple Views Visualization Research blog, which is a platform to communicate to practitioners,
