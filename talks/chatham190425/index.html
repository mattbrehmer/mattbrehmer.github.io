					<!-- VALUE OF ENABLING INFORMATION DESIGN ================================================== -->

							How can I enable people to <strong>visualize</strong> their data in context-appropriate ways? <br><br>
							From public presentation via large displays to individual consumption via mobile displays.
							<br><br><br>
							Applications of visualization <strong>beyond</strong> those in <strong>professional data analysis</strong>.
						</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							With respect to the values and goals that underlie my research,
							<br><br>
							I'm hope to enable more people to visualize their data in compelling and contextually-appropriate ways. 
							<br><br>
							And its in this respect that I contrast my research from that of many others in the broader visualization community, such as those working in visual analytics. 
							<br><br>
							Many in the visualization and visual analytics research community are motivated by use cases from professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. 
							<br><br> 
							While I think these use cases are important and I'm glad that people are thinking about them, they are <em>NOT</em> the use cases that motivate my recent research. 
							<br><br>
							Instead, over the past couple of years I've been interested in incorporating visualization to present information to people who don't identify as data analysts, in both public and personal contexts.
							<br><br>
							So I often think of news readers, students, policy makers, and citizens who consume visualization.

							<br><br>
							Established <strong>conventions</strong> in energy management limited the use of bar charts and line graphs.

							However, clients were <strong>unfamiliar</strong> with alternative design choices.

						<aside class="notes">
							After learning about the domain and the clients' tasks,

							I set about designing alternative ways to summarize the energy usage of a building portfolio,
							<br><br>
							Ways that would allow for clients to make better comparisons between buildings and over time.
							<br><br>
							These are some of the designs I considered.
							<br><br>
							Once notable constraint I faced was that bar charts and line charts, two of the most familiar representations,
							<br><br>
							Have a strong domain convention associated with them, in that line charts were used exclusively for raw energy demand and
							<br><br>
							Bar charts were used for consumption,

							To give you an example of a way to present timelines, I want to show you a brief presentation about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and other creative types.
							<br><br>
							When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had wondered if there was any pattern as to when creative people do their  creative work.
							<br><br>
							It turns out that at least among these people, some creative people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>
							Meanwhile, you have odd ones like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had also wondered about the potential relationship between sleep and creativity, so let me focus your attention to these blue arcs.
							<br><br>
							Most people here tend to sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>
							A third question I had was about variation and creativity. Let me show you how often these creative people change activities throughout their day.
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This 24-hour clock metaphor isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so I'm going to transition to a just show you a sequence of activities without any duration, effectively resulting in a radial bar chart. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To show who varied the most and least among these people, a linear representation is probably better, where you can see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people here while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, I'll restore the duration of events so that you can compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, where you might spot times where some routines appear to be in sync with one another, such as when people work or sleep at the same time.
							<br><br>
							And this is a good time to ask you to compare your own daily rhythm to these creative people.
							<br><br>
							When do you sleep, eat, or do you best creative work?

							It turns out that there are many ways to present timelines. 
							<br><br>
							You can represent time in various ways: linearly, radially, or by using spirals, grids such as calendars, or along a curve 
							<br><br>
							And you can combine these representations with different time scales: you could use an absolute or relative chronological scale, a logarithmic scale for extremely long-spanning timelines, or you could use a purely sequential scale.
							<br><br>
							And then there's "Layout", or how to draw one or more timelines within a page or display: 
							<br><br>
							This has to do with deciding between a single timeline, faceting into multiple timelines (like how I did for each creative person), 
							<br><br>
							Or wrapping a single timeline into meaningful segments of time, like a decade or a century.

								Different combinations of <strong>representation</strong>, time <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>layout</strong> serve different communicative tasks. <br><br>
								Anticipate <strong>chronological</strong> or <strong>non-chronological</strong> narratives.<br><br>
								Incrementally <strong>reveal</strong> visual elements, selectively <strong>highlighting</strong> and <strong>annotating</strong> to direct attention.
								<br><br><br><br>
								These considerations led to the development of <strong style="color:gold">Timeline Storyteller</strong>.
							</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							In this TVCG paper I make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time, time scales, and layouts,
							<br><br>
							As different combinations of these serve different communicative tasks.
							<br><br>
							For instance, sometimes I want to emphasize sequence without duration, other times periodicity.
							<br><br>
							I also discuss in this paper how existing timeline tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: 
							<br><br>
							Either the whole timeline is shown as a static image, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order, one event at a time as a series of slides.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,
							<br><br>
							Like how in my story about the routines of creative people, I revealed and highlighted aspects of those timelines in an order that wasn't chronological starting at midnight. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, you should make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.
							<br><br>
							Each of these considerations were realized in the tool Timeline Storyteller.

						<aside class="notes">
							In summary, Timeline Storyteller fills a gap in that no existing tool allows a non-programmer to present a visually expressive timeline narrative.
							<br><br>
							It's really the first to incorporate this animated multi-scene PowerPoint-like story format along with multiple visual representation choices;
							<br><br>
							And I believe that many aspects of its design can be applied to other forms of data, such as its ability to incrementally reveal and selectively highlight content.
							<br><br>
							Though we have collected only a few hundred examples of content that people produced using Timeline Storyteller that they elected to share with us,
							<br><br>
							Seeing this content made me realize the opportunity for providing overt recommendations of design choices, captions, and annotations more overtly within the application based on properties of the dataset, such as the temporal extent and distribution of the events.

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed stats including confidence intervals and effect sizes for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							In general, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't appear to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when identifying values or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							It's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.
							<br><br>
							Altogether these findings are interesting given the popularity of radial representations of time in practice and design communities.

							<br><br>
							Which is interesting since I had been seeing news graphics designers use small multiples for desktop and animation for mobile.

							Small multiples they may be particularly well-suited if the viewer's task requires detecting or noticing trajectory lengths or angles,

							Meanwhile, animation also seems to have circumstances in which it is suited,

							One area of interest that I've taken to over the past couple of years relates to interaction design beyond mouse and keyboard, 
							<br><br>
							Perhaps a side effect of being in a research group led by Ken Hinckley and being exposed to the group's bimanual touch and pen interaction research.
							<br><br>
							While in this group I was fortunate to contribute to several projects relating to the intersection of visualization design and pen and touch interaction.
							<br><br>
							I believe that there is a lot of potential for expressivity and highly personalized data-driven storytelling in this space.
