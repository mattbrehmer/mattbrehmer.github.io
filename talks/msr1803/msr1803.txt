Title: 

Visualizing Information on Mobile Phones: Recent Experiments, Novel Interactions, and Prospects for the Future

Abstract: 

Visualizing data on mobile phones is a growing interest for practitioners, yet it has attracted little attention from the visualization research community. Many mobile applications now incorporate visualization, and there is an increasing demand for responsive and mobile-first visualization design. I will describe the results of two recent experiments that were motivated by this demand, which were among the first crowdsourced visualization experiments to be conducted exclusively on mobile phones. The first experiment examines alternative representations of quantitative ranges over time, a form of data that is often encountered in activity tracking and weather reporting applications. In response to the use of animation in mobile-first news graphics, the second experiment assesses the extent to which animated and small multiple scatterplots support trend comparison tasks. In addition to experimental work, I will also describe recent interaction design work incorporating gestures and the orientation of the device, resulting in novel ways of interacting with data on a mobile phone. Finally, I will discuss the prospects for future research as well as opportunities to apply my research within the context of ongoing initiatives at Microsoft.

Bio:

Dr. Matthew Brehmer is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, where he is a member of the EPIC (Extended Perception, Interaction, & Cognition) research group. His research combines information visualization and human-computer interaction and is motivated by use cases in data-driven storytelling and journalism. His visualization work can be seen and used online and in Microsoft’s Power BI, and he has spoken about his work at venues such as IEEE VIS and OpenVisConf. He recently served as an organizer of the VisInPractice event at IEEE VIS and the Visual Data Storytelling Contest at IEEE PacificVis, and as a program committee member of VIS, Information+, Computation + Journalism, and the VIS Arts Program. Prior to joining Microsoft, he completed a PhD and a MSc at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he worked with Tamara Munzner and Joanna McGrenere.
