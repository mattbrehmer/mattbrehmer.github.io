						<aside class="notes">
							Expressive information design is about combining visualization, annotation, and explanation in various ways to present information to an audience,
							<br><br>
							It requires thinking systematically about the tasks that designers do, that presenters do, and what the audience is expected to do,
							<br><br>
							Similarly, it requires thinking about alternative design choices and the constraints imposed upon them,
							<br><br>
							And because I am a researcher, it involves assessing these design choices in appropriate ways,

							And disseminating the results of these assessments.

						<aside class="notes">
							A central theme of my PhD research pertained to classifying visualization tasks and to consolidating the vocabulary for visualization tasks into a typology,

							Which is the subject of a 2013 paper written with my PhD advisor Tamara Munzner.
							<br><br>
							And expressive information design involves being able to address a wide range of tasks, 
							<br><br>							
							And by this I refer to both the tasks of a visualization producer or author, as well as the tasks of a viewer, or what the audience is expected to do with the information presented to them. 
							<br><br>
							Such as to identify a trend or to compare values.
							<br><br>
							Ultimately, expressivity is about satisfying the intent of the author, allowing them to tell the story they want to tell,

						<aside class="notes">
						Expressivity also refers to a palette of design choices, or what I'll refer to as design spaces: 
						<br><br>						
						Which are systematic ways of categorizing visual representation choices for a particular type and amount of data, of interaction design choices, of ways to highlight, annotate, and embellish visual representations, or of ways to combine visual and textual explanations in compelling and engaging ways. 
						<br><br>
						Characterizing these design spaces becomes particularly important when you decide to expose them to an author in the form of an information design tool, where there is a question about the level of granularity: 
						<br><br>						
						For example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?

						As you'll see this process identifying and assessing points in the design space in the two focus sections later in this talk.

							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							One constraint is expertise: 
							<br><br>						
							I want to empower non-programmers to present information with interactive visualization and presentation tools.

							<br><br>
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Yet another constraint is context: 
							<br><br>						
							What if my audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy needed to interpret my particular choice of visual representation? 
							<br><br>
							How can I make use of their prior knowledge as part of the communication process?

							What if my audience is consuming this information from a mobile device?

						<br><br>
						More important are the human-centred research methods that I use,

						Which includes lab-based experimental work before my PhD and more recent experimental work involving crowdsourcing,
						<br><br>
						As well as extensive qualitative evaluation work during my PhD in the context of visualization design studies,
						<br><br>
						Which included content analysis, requirements analysis, and the adoption analysis of a deployed visualization tool.
						<br><br>
						And finally there's the theory development that comes from systematically collecting and categorizing previous research as well as visualization work in the wild.

							This is a good moment to situate my research from that of others in the broader visualization community, such as those working in visual analytics like Brian. 
							<br><br>
							Many in the visualization and visual analytics research community are motivated by use cases from professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. 
							<br><br> 
							While I think these use cases are important and I'm glad that people are thinking about them, they are <em>NOT</em> the use cases that motivate my research. 
							<br><br>
							Instead, I'm interested in incorporating visualization to present information to people who don't identify as data analysts, in both public and personal contexts.
							<br><br>
							This leads me to ask questions like ``why are journalists and educators are using business intelligence tools to present to their audiences``?
							<br><br>
							Can I build better tools for these communities?
							<br><br>
							Or can can I identify best practices for the visual display of personal information on a mobile phone?

							Whether that's based on health or activity data, personal finance data, or other personally-relevant data.

						Finally, increasing expressivity and democratizing visualization are only possible if there is an ongoing process of communication and outreach between visualization researchers and practitioners.

						This means disseminating research into practice, and just as importantly, disseminating practice into research.

						As you'll see in my own research, this manifests as studying the adoption of deployed tools and prototypes.

						And collecting examples of information design produced by practitioners.

							I'm going to start this section off by presenting a story about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and the like.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Have you ever wondered: when do creative people create? Or are all creative people similar in this regard?
							<br><br>It turns out that some creative people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have people like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Now I want to tell you about the potential relationship between sleep and creativity, and possibly to dispel any potential misconceptions that creative people have irregular schedules.
							<br><br>Most people here tend to sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>What about variation and creativity? Let me show you how often these creative people change activities throughout their day.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This 24-hour clock isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so I'm going to transition to a just show you a sequence of activities without any duration, effectively resulting in a bar chart wrapped radially. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To show who varied the most and least among these people, a linear representation is perhaps best, where you can see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people here 
							<br><br>while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, I'll restore the duration of events so that you can compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, where you might spot times where some routines appear to be in sync with one another, such as when people work or sleep at the same time.
							<br><br>And now I ask you the audience to compare your own daily rhythm to these creative people.
							<br><br>When do you sleep, eat, or do you best creative work?

						<aside class="notes">
							In this TVCG paper I make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							I should also emphasize that existing timeline presentation tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: either the whole timeline is shown as a static image, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order, one event at a time, like a slide deck.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,<br><br>
							Like in my creative people story, I revealed and highlighted aspects of those timelines in an order that wasn't chronological starting at midnight . 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, designers should make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

						<aside class="notes">
						But the real break came when Power BI decided to feature a live demo of Timeline Storyteller in the opening keynote of the 2017 Data Insights Summit, a major Microsoft customer conference. 
						<br><br>
						This was in front of about three thousand people and recorded online, and if that wasn't worrying enough, Power BI asked a customer to demo it using data from his organization,
						<br><br>
						Which in this case was the UK National Trust, a heritage foundation that maintains historic landmarks. 
						<br><br>
						So while I sat nervously at the back of this auditorium, the demo proceeded and thankfully it didn't break and the audience seemed to be quite impressed.

						<small style="text-align: left">
							<strong>No prior interactive tools</strong> for presenting <strong>expressive timeline narratives</strong>.
							<br><br>
							The <strong></strong>first</strong> to incorporate multi-scene stories with <strong>unconventional visual representations</strong>.
							<br><br>
							Incremental <strong>reveal</strong> + <strong>transform</strong>; selective <strong>highlight</strong> + <strong>annotate</strong> can be applied to other data types</strong>.
							<br><br><br><br>
							<strong>Recommend design choices</strong> and <strong>annotations</strong> based on properties of the dataset.
							<br><br>
							The viewing experience ought to be <strong>more responsive</strong>.
						</small>							

						<aside class="notes">
							To wrap up this section, Timeline Storyteller fills a gap in that no existing tool allows a non-programmer to present a visually expressive timeline narrative.
							<br><br>
							It's really the first to incorporate this animated multi-scene PowerPoint-like story format with unconventional visual representations;
							<br><br>
							As others have done with conventional charts like bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots.
							<br><br>
							And I believe that many aspects of its design can be applied to other forms of data, such as its ability to incrementally reveal and selectively highlight content.
							<br><br>
							We're still learning about how it's being used in the wild, 
							<br><br>
							As our limited evaluation of content analysis and usage only revealed so much.
							<br><br>
							While the content produced does reflect our timeline design space to an extent.
							<br><br>   
							Seeing this content made me realize the opportunity for providing overt recommendations of design choices, captions, and annotations within the application based on properties of the dataset, such as the temporal extent and distribution of the events.
							<br><br>   
							I also realized an opportunity to improve the viewing experience of content produced with Timeline Storyteller, particularly on mobile devices, which is a topic that I'll cover in the second focus area of this talk.

							ChartAccent, which is an interactive tool for annotating charts via direct manipulation, 
							<br><br>
							This project was also motivated by a desire to bridge research and practice,

							I've touched upon the evaluation of Timeline Storyteller as an expressive information design tool, but a related question is how should I evaluate the quality of the stories that it creates? 
							<br><br>
							And how should the visualization community evaluate data-driven stories more generally?  
							<br><br>
							Consider a story that makes use of visualization, text, and potentially interaction. 
							<br><br>
							It might incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it any good?
							<br><br>
							So these questions led to a book chapter that I contributed to in last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book, where my co-authors included a journalist and an information designer,
							<br><br>
							Where we attempted to catalog all the ways you might evaluate a data-driven story.
							<br><br>
							The implication here is that our expressive information design tools should accommodate or at least anticipate the need for each of these elements, and that tools for highly expressive visualization are not enough to tell a good story.

							One of the main research question of this work relates to the linear convention used when visualizing ranges over time. 
							<br><br>
							As you recall from the timeline project, time is also cyclical; we experience seasons, lunar cycles, and weekday/weekend routines. 						
							<br><br>						
							The cyclicality of time is exemplified in work like Tim Kekeritz's Weather Radials, or in a number of radial range charts featured in Manuel Lima's Book of Circles.

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed inferential stats and effect sizes that I computed for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							People tend to complete comparison tasks in about the same amount of time with either representation, but for tasks that require locating values, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't seem to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when reading values for specific dates or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							So you might be wondering if these results cast doubt on radial representations in general, this despite their popularity in practice and design communities. 
							<br><br>
							But my results are somewhat more nuanced and dependent upon data source and task. 
							<br><br>
							And it's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.

						This means giving more people the ability to visualize their data: 
						<br><br>
						To take a process that would have previously required programming expertise, visual design expertise, and / or ample amounts of time, and instead offer an interactive experience that provides both expressivity and design guidance.
						<br><br>
						The groups of people that I hope to work with here include:
						<br><br>
						Local and small- to mid-sized newsrooms that don't have dedicated visualization staff, educators preparing lecture content, and curators of cultural institutions and digital collections.

						Oarticularly when more of this interaction is occurring in a post-mouse + keyboard world, with mobile and multimodal interaction, and with mixed reality. 
						<br><br>
						As these technologies evolve, the challenge will be how I can provide discoverable, useful, and enjoyable interactions with this content.

						The first is how do I ensure that the information presented these stories is memorable? Or personally relevant?

						I need to collect both good and bad examples, distill design patterns, and comparatively test them, both in the lab and in the wild.

						A second opportunity pertains to the combination of data literacy and visual literacy, or what journalist and author Alberto Cairo refers to as "graphicacy". 
						<br><br>
						Here there are opportunities to innovate in annotation, the pairing of data-bound visual elements with an annotation layer and with adjacent textual explanations.
						<br><br>
						This is particularly needed when there is an aspect of uncertainty in the data, where complementary visual representations and text can be used as scaffolding to learn new visual representations.

							The students are trained in <span style="color:gold">information design</span>, <span style="color:gold">visual communication design</span>, and <span style="color:gold">interaction design</span>.

							<br><br>
							Cascadia (Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle) is the world's <span style="color:gold">best place to do visualization research</span>. 
							<br><br>
							It is the ideal place to establish an <span style="color:gold">Expressive Information Design</span> group. 
						</small>
	
						<aside class="notes">
							First, the students here are trained in subjects that I care deeply about, such as information design, visual communication design, and interaction design, which is not guaranteed in a computer science department.
							<br><br>
							Second, there are opportunities to collaborate with faculty members in application areas of mutual interest, such as resource conservation, health, and cultural heritage.
							<br><br>
							And finally because the greater Vancouver area and Cascadia by extension has become the hub for visualization research, providing opportunities to collaborate between SFU, UBC, UW, and UVic, as well as industry connections to places like Microsoft and Tableau.
							<br><br>
							And thus it is the ideal place to establish an expressive information design group.
