						<aside class="notes">
							Now you may be wondering about how my interests set me apart from others in the visualization community, and from those working in visual analytics like Brian. 
							<br><br>
							Many in the visualization and visual analytics research community are motivated by use cases from professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. 
							<br><br> 
							While I think these use cases are important and I'm glad that people are thinking about them, they are <em>NOT</em> the use cases that motivate my research. 
							<br><br>
							You may be surprised that I do visualization research motivated by public and personal applications of visualization at a place like Microsoft, with its renown for productivity software and applications like Power BI (where the BI stands for business intelligence). <br><br> 

							However, you might not be aware of initiatives like Microsoft's Modern Journalism Program and the use of Power BI in online news dissemination, <br><br>
							
							Or Microsoft Research's investments in personal health technology;<br><br> 
							
							And both of these initiatives contribute to the motivation for my research.

						<aside class="notes">
						Expressivity also refers to a palette of design choices: <br><br>
						
						Of visual representation choices, or interaction design choices, of ways to highlight, annotate, and otherwise embellishing information graphics, and of ways to combine visual and textual explanations in compelling and engaging ways. <br><br>

						And for each of these design choices, there is a question about the level of granularity: <br><br>
						
						For example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Constraints</span> on Expressivity</h4>

						Expressivity is also bound to constraints, and it is these constraints that I find to be particularly challenging and deserving of research.

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Expertise</span> Constraints</h4>

						I want to empower non-programmers to visualize their data<br><br>
						
						And I want to empower non-designers to make compelling and useful information graphics?

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Limited Resource</span> Constraints</h4>
						<hr>
						<small>How can I support visualization design for those on a deadline?</small>

						<aside class="notes">
						Another constraint is about resources: <br><br>
						
						I want to enable over-committed, understaffed, and poorly funded local news teams to produce data-driven stories about their community while meeting all their deadlines.
						<br><br>
						Similarly I want to enable professors and teachers to produce visual explanations for all of their lectures? 
						</aside>

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section data-background="assets/smartphone.png"data-background-opacity=0.15>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Context</span> Constraints</h4>
						<hr>
						<small style="text-align:left">
							What are the best practices for visualization design on mobile devices?<br><br>
							How can I improve data literacy among the audience for visualization content? 
						</small>

						<aside class="notes">
						Yet another constraint is context: <br><br>
						
						What if my audience is consuming my visualization content from a mobile device? <br><br>

						Or what if my audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy needed to interpret my particular choice of visual representation? 
						<br><br>
						How can I make use of their prior knowledge as part of the communication process?

					<!-- ================================================== -->

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Democratizing</span> Data Visualization</h4>
						<hr>
						<small style="text-align:left">
							How can I enable more people to... <br><br><br><br>
							Expressively visualize their data? <br><br>
							Present compelling data-driven stories?<br><br>
							Make personal decisions grounded in data?
						</small>

						<aside class="notes">
						Addressing each of these constraints serves the larger goal of democratizing data visualization: <br><br>
						
						And this means enabling more people to visualize their data, tell stories, and make decisions that are grounded in data that is relevant to their personal lives.

						<span class="attribution">The VisInPractice speaker series at IEEE VIS: <a href="https://visinpractice.github.io" target="_blank">VisInPractice.github.io</a>.</span></span>

						<aside class="notes">
						Finally, increasing expressivity and democratizing visualization are only possible if there is an ongoing process of communication and outreach between visualization researchers and practitioners. <br><br> 

						This means disseminating research into practice, and just as importantly, disseminating practice into research. <br><br> 

						I can speak to this interplay directly as an organizer of the VisInPractice speaker series at the IEEE VIS conference, where we invite visualization practitioners speak to a largely academic audience. 
						<br><br>
						I also bring the perspective of someone based in an industrial research lab who consults with product groups, as someone who has deployed visualization tools, and as a researcher who speaks and demos at practitioner conferences.

						I began collecting and systematically categorizing how people have drawn timelines over the course of history to present stories.<br><br> 

						I did so upon realizing that most of the visualization research community has focused on timelines and their uses in data analysis, such as for understanding patterns in electronic health records.<br><br>

						Because of this focus, the expressive range of design choices considered by the research community was far smaller than the range of design choices considered by the design and practice community.

						<aside class="notes">
							So I will make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							And I should emphasize that existing timeline presentation tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: either the whole timeline is shown up front, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,<br><br>
							Like in my painters example, I revealed the career of Matisse after I showed you Dali's, which added context to his career. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, we can make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

							As a second example that ties all of this together, I'm going to use Timeline Storyteller to present a story about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and the like.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: A good starting point is to ask: when do creative people create? Are people similar in this regard?
							<br><br>It looks as though some people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have people like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I can also ask about the relationship between sleep and creativity: how much? how often? and when do creative people sleep?
							<br><br>Most people in this dataset sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.

							I've touched upon the evaluation of Timeline Storyteller as an expressive information design tool, but a related question is how do we evaluate the quality of the stories that it creates? 
							<br><br>
							And how do we evaluate data-driven stories more generally?  
							<br><br>
							Consider a story that makes use of visualization, text, and potentially interaction. 
							<br><br>
							It might incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it any good?
							<br><br>
							So these questions led to a book chapter that I contributed to in last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book, where my co-authors included a journalist and an information designer,
							<br><br>
							Where we attempted to catalog all the ways you might evaluate a data-driven story.
							<br><br>
							The implication here is that our expressive information design tools should accommodate or at least anticipate the need for each of these elements, and that tools for highly expressive visualization are not enough to tell a good story.

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed inferential stats and effect sizes that I computed for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							People tend to complete comparison tasks in about the same amount of time with either representation, but for tasks that require locating values, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't seem to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when reading values for specific dates or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							So you might be wondering if these results cast doubt on radial representations in general, this despite their popularity in practice and design communities. 
							<br><br>
							But my results are somewhat more nuanced and dependent upon data source and task. 
							<br><br>
							And it's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.

							Second, there are opportunities to collaborate with faculty members in application areas of mutual interest, such as resource conservation, health, and cultural heritage.
