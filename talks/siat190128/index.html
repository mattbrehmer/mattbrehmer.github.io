							It's is about combining visualization, annotation, and explanation in various ways to present information to an audience,

							It requires thinking systematically about the tasks that designers do, that presenters do, and what the audience is expected to do with the resulting information,
							<br><br>
							Similarly, it requires thinking about alternative design choices and the constraints imposed upon them,

							And because I am a researcher, it involves assessing these design choices in appropriate ways,

						<aside class="notes">
							A central theme of my PhD research pertained to classifying visualization tasks and to consolidating the vocabulary for visualization tasks into a typology,
							<br><br>
							Which is the subject of a 2013 paper written with my PhD advisor Tamara Munzner.
							<br><br>
							And expressive information design involves being able to address a wide range of tasks, 
							<br><br>							
							And by this I refer to both the tasks of an information designer or author, as well as the tasks of a viewer, or what the audience is expected to do with the information presented to them. 
							<br><br>
							Such as to identify a trend or to compare values.
							<br><br>
							Ultimately, expressivity is about satisfying the intent of the author, allowing them to tell the story they want to tell,

							Identifying the dimensions of <strong>design spaces</strong> that characterize:<br><br>

						Expressivity also refers to thinking systematically about design choices and design spaces: 
						<br><br>						
						Which are ways to categorize visual representation choices for a particular type of data, 
						<br><br>
						Interaction design choices, ways to highlight, annotate, and embellish visual representations, 
						<br><br>
						Or ways to combine visual and textual explanations in compelling and engaging ways. 
						<br><br>
						Characterizing these design spaces becomes particularly important when you decide to expose them to an author in the form of an information design tool, where there is a question about the level of granularity: 
						<br><br>						
						For example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?
						<br><br>
						As you'll see this process identifying and assessing points in the design space in the two focus sections later in this talk.

					<!-- CONSTRAINTS ON EXPRESSIVITY ================================================== -->

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Constraints</span> on Expressivity</h4>

						<aside class="notes">
							Expressivity is also bound to constraints, and it is these constraints that I find to be particularly challenging and deserving of research. 
							<br><br>
							And these include constraints imposed by designers or authors, as well as those imposed by the audience and the context in which the information is presented.
							<br><br>			
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							One of these constraints is expertise: 
							<br><br>						
							I want to empower non-programmers to present information with interactive visualization and presentation tools.
							<br><br>						
							And I want to empower non-designers to make compelling and useful information graphics by offering design guidance.  		
							<br><br>		
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Another constraint is about resources: 
							<br><br>						
							For example, I want to enable over-committed, understaffed, and poorly funded local news teams to produce data-driven stories about their community while meeting all their deadlines.
							<br><br>							
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Yet another constraint is literacy: 
							<br><br>						
							What if my audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy needed to interpret my particular choice of visual representation? 
							<br><br>
							How can I make use of their prior knowledge as part of the communication process?
							<br><br>
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							And finally there's the device: what if my audience is consuming this information from a mobile device? 
							<br><br>
							How does that constrain my choices?

						as well as software development for a deployed product, a research toolkit, and various visualization tools and experimental applications.

						This includes extensive qualitative evaluation work during my PhD in the context of visualization design studies,

						Which involve everything from content analysis to requirements analysis and usage analysis of deployed visualization tools.

						This qualitative work also contributes to theory development, where I've systematically collected and categorized previous research as well as information design content by practitioners.

							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Have you ever wondered: when do creative people create? Or are all creative people similar in this regard?
							<br><br>It turns out that some creative people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have people like Kafka who work all night long.

							<br><br>Most people here tend to sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>What about variation and creativity? Let me show you how often these creative people change activities throughout their day.

							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To show who varied the most and least among these people, a linear representation is perhaps best, where you can see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people here 
							<br><br>while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, I'll restore the duration of events so that you can compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, where you might spot times where some routines appear to be in sync with one another, such as when people work or sleep at the same time.

							</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							In this TVCG paper I make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							I should also emphasize that existing timeline presentation tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: 
							<br><br>
							Either the whole timeline is shown as a static image, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order, one event at a time as a series of slides.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,
							<br><br>
							Like how in my story about the routines of creative people, I revealed and highlighted aspects of those timelines in an order that wasn't chronological starting at midnight. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, designers should make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

							A controlled <strong>laboratory study</strong> to assess expressivity seemed to be <strong>inappropriate</strong>.<br><br>
							How do people use it <strong>with their own data</strong>?<br><br>
							How does the content they produce <strong>reflect</strong> our timeline <strong>design space</strong>? 
						</small>	

						<aside class="notes">
							Since its release in mid 2017, I've been thinking about ways to evaluate Timeline Storyteller and to better understand how people are using it.   
							<br><br>
							For an expressive information design tool like Timeline Storyteller, a controlled user study in a lab measuring task completion time and error didn't seem appropriate. 
							<br><br>
							I was instead interested in finding out how people would express themselves with their own data and on their own time, 
							<br><br>							
							And to determine if my timeline design space and the ideas put forward in the prior TVCG paper would be reflected in what people make.

						<small style="text-align: left">
							<strong>No prior interactive tools</strong> for presenting <strong>expressive timeline narratives</strong>.
							<br><br>
							The <strong></strong>first</strong> to incorporate multi-scene stories with <strong>multiple visual representation choices</strong>.
							<br><br>
							Incrementally <strong>reveal</strong> + <strong>transform</strong>; selectively <strong>highlight</strong> + <strong>annotate</strong>; applicable to other data types</strong>.
							<br><br><br><br>
							<strong>Recommend design choices</strong> and <strong>annotations</strong> based on properties of the dataset.
						</small>							

						<aside class="notes">
							In summary, Timeline Storyteller fills a gap in that no existing tool allows a non-programmer to present a visually expressive timeline narrative.
							<br><br>
							It's really the first to incorporate this animated multi-scene PowerPoint-like story format along with multiple visual representation choices;
							<br><br>
							And I believe that many aspects of its design can be applied to other forms of data, such as its ability to incrementally reveal and selectively highlight content.
							<br><br>
							We're still learning about how it's being used in the wild, 
							<br><br>
							As our limited evaluation of content analysis and usage only revealed so much.
							<br><br>
							And while the content produced does reflect our timeline design space to an extent,
							<br><br>   
							Seeing this content made me realize the opportunity for providing overt recommendations of design choices, captions, and annotations more overtly within the application based on properties of the dataset, such as the temporal extent and distribution of the events.

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed stats including confidence intervals and effect sizes for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							In general, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't seem to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when identifying values or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							It's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.
							<br><br>
							Altogether these findings are interesting given the popularity of radial representations of time in practice and design communities.

							A second opportunity pertains to audience constraints,

							Such as their limited "graphicacy", which is how renowned journalist and author Alberto Cairo refers to the combination of data, visual, and statistical literacy. 
							<br><br>
							I want to identify how to measure this construct as well as how to improve it.
							<br><br>
							There's also the constraint of the audience's limited attention span and the challenge of designing information that both attracts this attention and yet does not mislead or misinform.
							<br><br>
							Finally there's the constraint imposed by small displays, which motivates me to identify where the limitations are for visual representation and interaction design choices.
							<br><br>
							And I'll reiterate that there's not a lot of prior research from the visualization community when it comes to mobile devices, and I plan to fix this. 
							<br><br>
							And for each of these constraints, I believe more experimental work is needed, both in the lab and with online crowd worker participants.

							First, Unlike in a computer science department such as the one where I did my PhD,
							<br><br>
							The students here are trained in subjects that I care deeply about, such as information design, visual communication design, and interaction design.
							<br><br>
							Second, there are opportunities to collaborate with faculty members in application areas of mutual interest, such as resource conservation, health, and cultural heritage.
							<br><br>
							Third, I believe that my research already reflects the stated themes of research at SIAT:
							<br><br>
							Interactive computing, design, people, and the science of interaction.
							<br><br>
							And finally because the greater Vancouver area and Cascadia by extension has become the hub for visualization research, providing opportunities to collaborate between SFU, UBC, UW, and UVic, as well as industry connections to places like Microsoft and Tableau.
							<br><br>
							And thus I think it is the ideal place to establish an expressive information design group.

							The evaluation of Timeline Storyteller and these other expressive information design tools has also allowed me to reflect on the methods for evaluating them.

							And so I recently contributed to this BELIV paper, where BELIV is a VIS workshop dedicated to evaluation methods for visualization.

							And in it I commented on the process of analyzing content produced once a tool is deployed, which was the case with Timeline Storyteller,
							<br><br>
							As well as on the chart reproduction studies that we performed for ChartAccent and Charticulator, in which we asked study participants to reproduce a completed chart using the tool.

						<aside class="notes">							
							The process of looking at the content produced with Timeline Storyteller and other tools also makes me wonder about
							<br><br>
							How the visualization community should evaluate data-driven stories more generally.
							<br><br>
							Consider a story that makes use of visualization, text, and potentially interaction. 
							<br><br>
							It might incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it any good?
							<br><br>
							So in book chapter that I wrote for last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book,
							<br><br>
							My co-authors and I attempted to catalog all the ways you might evaluate this form of content.
							<br><br>
							And we also did our best to consider different perspectives and constraints from both research and practice,
							<br><br>
							Which was possible as one of our co-authors was Christina Elmer, a data journalist from Der Spiegl in Germany, 
							<br><br>
							And another was Benjamin Wiederkehr, who leads the Interactive Things information design firm in Switzerland.
