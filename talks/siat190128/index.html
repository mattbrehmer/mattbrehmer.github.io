							Expressive information design is about combining visualization, annotation, and explanation in various ways to present information to an audience,

							Similarly, it requires thinking about alternative design choices and the constraints imposed upon them,
							<br><br>
							And because I am a researcher, it involves assessing these design choices in appropriate ways,

							A central theme of my PhD research pertained to classifying visualization tasks and to consolidating the vocabulary for visualization tasks into a typology,
							<br><br>
							Which is the subject of a 2013 paper written with my PhD advisor Tamara Munzner.
							<br><br>
							And expressive information design involves being able to address a wide range of tasks, 
							<br><br>							
							And by this I refer to both the tasks of a visualization producer or author, as well as the tasks of a viewer, or what the audience is expected to do with the information presented to them. 
							<br><br>
							Such as to identify a trend or to compare values.
							<br><br>
							Ultimately, expressivity is about satisfying the intent of the author, allowing them to tell the story they want to tell,

						<aside class="notes">
						Expressivity also refers to a palette of design choices, or what I'll refer to as design spaces: 
						<br><br>						
						Which are systematic ways of categorizing visual representation choices for a particular type and amount of data, of interaction design choices, of ways to highlight, annotate, and embellish visual representations, or of ways to combine visual and textual explanations in compelling and engaging ways. 
						<br><br>
						Characterizing these design spaces becomes particularly important when you decide to expose them to an author in the form of an information design tool, where there is a question about the level of granularity: 
						<br><br>						
						For example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?

						As you'll see this process identifying and assessing points in the design space in the two focus sections later in this talk.

							<br><br>			
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							One constraint is expertise: 
							<br><br>						
							I want to empower non-programmers to present information with interactive visualization and presentation tools.

							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Another constraint is about resources:

							<br><br>
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Yet another constraint is context: 
							<br><br>						
							What if my audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy needed to interpret my particular choice of visual representation?

							How can I make use of their prior knowledge as part of the communication process?

						More important are the human-centred research methods that I use,

							Instead, I'm interested in incorporating visualization to present information to people who don't identify as data analysts, in both public and personal contexts.
							<br><br>
							This leads me to ask questions like ``why are journalists and educators are using business intelligence tools to present to their audiences``?
							<br><br>
							Can I build better tools for these communities?
							<br><br>
							Or can can I identify best practices for the visual display of personal information on a mobile phone?

							Whether that's based on health or activity data, personal finance data, or other personally-relevant data.

						Finally, increasing expressivity and democratizing visualization are only possible if there is an ongoing process of communication and outreach between visualization researchers and practitioners.

						As you'll see in my own research, this manifests as studying the adoption of deployed tools and prototypes.

							<br><br>
							In other words, how do you combine different points in this design space?

							</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							So I will make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							And I should emphasize that existing timeline presentation tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: either the whole timeline is shown up front, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,<br><br>
							Like in my painters example, I revealed the career of Matisse after I showed you Dali's, which added context to his career. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, we can make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

							For an design tool such as Timeline Storyteller, a controlled user study in a lab measuring task completion time and error didn't seem appropriate. 
							<br><br>
							I was instead interested in finding out how people would express themselves with their own data and on their own time, <br><br>
							
							And to determine if my timeline design space and the ideas put forward in its related journal paper would be reflected in what people make.

							I've touched upon the evaluation of Timeline Storyteller as an expressive information design tool, but a related question is how do we evaluate the quality of the stories that it creates? 
							<br><br>
							And how do we evaluate data-driven stories more generally?  
							<br><br>
							Consider a story that makes use of visualization, text, and potentially interaction. 
							<br><br>
							It might incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it any good?
							<br><br>
							So these questions led to a book chapter that I contributed to in last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book, where my co-authors included a journalist and an information designer,
							<br><br>
							Where we attempted to catalog all the ways you might evaluate a data-driven story.
							<br><br>
							The implication here is that our expressive information design tools should accommodate or at least anticipate the need for each of these elements, and that tools for highly expressive visualization are not enough to tell a good story.

							In the interest of time, I won't get into the detailed inferential stats and effect sizes that I computed for each task, which you can find in the paper; for now, I'll stick to high-level results. 
							<br><br>
							People tend to complete comparison tasks in about the same amount of time with either representation, but for tasks that require locating values, people tend to be slower with radial representations, irrespective of the source of the data.
							<br><br>					
							However, radial representations don't seem to incur accuracy costs, at least with temperature range data, where there tends to be a lot of seasonal variation.
							<br><br>
							With sleep range data, which exhibits no seasonal variation, people are less accurate when reading values for specific dates or when locating extreme values.
							<br><br>
							So you might be wondering if these results cast doubt on radial representations in general, this despite their popularity in practice and design communities. 
							<br><br>
							But my results are somewhat more nuanced and dependent upon data source and task. 
							<br><br>
							And it's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear representations, and they felt more confident using linear representations relative to radial ones.

						My colleagues in the HCI group at Microsoft are some of the leaders when it comes to pen and touch interaction design, and I've collaborated with them already on two projects that unite these interactions with data visualization.
						<br><br>
						I'd like to continue to investigate the potential of pen and touch interactions for drawing and annotating timelines, particularly in the context of live presentations and in application domains such as education.

						I've now done two experiments that assess alternative visual representations across tasks.

						Next I'm going to look at the design of multidimensional glyphs on mobile phones and their scalability, which takes inspiration from the many activity and exercise tracking apps now on the market, likely using a similar experimental protocol to the two mobile visualization studies that I've told you about.
