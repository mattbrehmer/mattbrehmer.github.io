						<aside class="notes">
							I want to begin with the question "Why visualization?"" or "Why do I think data visualization is important and relevant as we look toward the third decade of the 21st century?"
						</aside>

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section>

						<h4>Visualization in a <span style="color:gold">Societal</span> Context</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
							What interests me about visualization is its value in a societal context. Visualization allows people to tell richer stories that are grounded in data, to present data-driven narratives. <br><br>

							Here I refer to visualization in the context of journalism, education, and public institutions where the intent is to present information to an audience.

						<h4>Visualization in a <span style="color:gold">Personal</span> Context</h4>

						<h4>Information Visualization and Visual Analytics</h4>
						<hr>

							What about these interests sets me apart from others in the information visualization community, and from those working in visual analytics, which has an established presence here with VIVA. <br><br>

							<span style="color:red"><< CLICK >></span> As you'll see when I get into the details of my research program, I am not primarily motivated by visualization in the context of professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. <br><br> 

							This might strike you as odd given my affiliation and the Microsoft's renown for productivity software and applications like Power BI (where the BI stands for business intelligence). <br><br> 

							However, you might not be aware of initiatives like Microsoft's Modern Journalism Program and the use of Power BI in online news dissemination, or Microsoft Research's investments in personal health technology; both of these initiatives contribute to the motivations for the research that I will be telling you about today.

				<!-- WHY EXPRESSIVITY ================================================== -->

				<section>

					<section>

						<h4>WHY <span style="color:gold">EXPRESSIVITY</span>?</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
							So why is expressivity important? <br><br> 

							And what does expressivity mean in the context of visualization and information design? <br><br>  

							<span style="color:red"><< CLICK >></span> First of all, it's about being to address a wide range of tasks, and by this I refer to both the tasks of a visualization producer or designer, as well as the tasks of a viewer, or what the audience is expected to do with an information graphic. <br><br>   

							Ultimately, expressivity is about the intent of the designer (the message or story they want to tell) and whether this story can be reconstructed in the mind of the viewer.

						<h4>Expressing Visualization <span style="color:gold">Tasks</span></h4>
						<hr>

						<span class="attribution"><span style="color:gold"><em>A Multi-Level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks</em></span>. <span style="font-weight: 700">Brehmer</span> and Munzner. <br>In <em>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</em> (TVCG, VIS 2013, InfoVis Track).<br>
						Icons by Eamonn Maguire / Antarctic Design (CC-BY-4.0).</span>

						<aside class="notes">
						A central theme of my PhD research pertained to classifying visualization tasks and to consolidating the vocabulary for visualization tasks into a typology. <br><br>

						It would seem as though the visualization community has appreciated this effort and has found it to be useful for speaking about the expressiveness of visualization, since my task typology paper written with my PhD advisor Tamara Munzner has gone on to be the most cited InfoVis paper since 2013, with more than 280 citations.

						<h4>Visualization Design Choices</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						Expressivity also refers to a palette of design choices: of visual representation choices, or interaction design choices, of ways to highlight, annotate, and embellish information graphics, and of ways to combine visual and textual explanations in compelling and engaging ways. <br><br>

						And for each of these design choices, there is a question about the level of granularity: for example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Constraints</span> on Expressivity</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						Expressivity is also bound to constraints, and it is these constraints that I find to be particularly challenging and worthy of research.

					</section>

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Expertise</span> Constraints</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						One constraint is expertise: how can we empower non-programmers to visualize data? Or how can we empower non-designers to make compelling and useful information graphics?  

						</aside>

					</section>

					<!-- ================================================== -->

					<section>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Limited Resources</span> Constraints</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						Another constraint is resources: how can we empower overcommitted, understaffed, and poorly funded local news teams to produce data-driven stories about their community while meeting all their deadlines? <br><br>

						Or how can we empower professors and teachers to produce visual explanations for all of their lectures? 

						</aside>

					<section data-background="assets/smartphone.png"data-background-opacity=0.15>

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Context</span> Constraints</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						Yet another constraint is context: what if your audience is consuming your content from a mobile device? <br><br>

						Or what if your audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy to interpret your favourite chart type?

						<h4><span style="color:gold">Democratizing</span> Data Visualization</h4>

						Addressing these constraints serves the larger goal of democratizing data visualization: enabling more people to visualize data and tell stories.

					<!-- ================================================== -->

						<h4>Visualizing <span style="color:gold">Personally-Relevant</span> Data</h4>
						<hr>

						<aside class="notes">
						Finally, increasing expressivity and democratizing visualization are only possible if there is an ongoing process of communication and outreach between visualization researchers and practitioners. <br><br> 

						This means disseminating research into practice, and just as importantly, disseminating practice into research. <br><br> 

						I can speak to this interplay between research and practice as an organizer of the VisInPractice speaker series at the IEEE VIS conference, where we invite prominent practitioners speak to a largely academic audience, as an industrial research lab employee who consults with product groups, as someone who has deployed visualization tools, and as a researcher who speaks and demos at practitioner conferences.

						<h4>TIMELINES REVISITED</h4>

						<span class="attribution"><span style="color:gold"><em>Timelines Revisited: A Design Space and Considerations for Expressive Storytelling</em></span>. <br><span style="font-weight: 700">Brehmer</span>, Lee, Bach, Riche, and Munzner. In <em>IEEE TVCG</em> 2017.

						<aside class="notes">
						In late 2014 I became arguably obsessed by timelines and the potential for expressive information design with this form of data: annotated and categorized sequences of events used to tell stories in the domains of journalism, education, and project management.<br><br> 

						I began collecting and systematically categorizing how people have drawn timelines over the course of history to present stories.<br><br> 

						I did so upon realizing that most of the relevant visualization research literature has focused on timelines and their uses in data analysis, such as for understanding patterns in electronic health records.<br><br>

						Because of this focus, the expressive range of design choices considered by the research community was far smaller than the range of design choices considered by the design and practice community.

						<aside class="notes">
							As a second example that ties all of this together, I'm going to present a story about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and the like.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: A good starting point is to ask: when do creative people create? Are people similar in this regard?
							<br><br>It looks as though some people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have people like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: We can also ask about the relationship between sleep and creativity: how much? how often? and when do creative people sleep?
							<br><br>Most people in this dataset sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>What about variation and creativity? How often should you change activities if you want to be creative?
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This chronological scale isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so let's transition to a sequential scale. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To determine who varied the most and least, a linear representation is perhaps best, where we can easily see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people in this dataset, 
							<br><br>while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, we can restore chronology to compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, to spot synchronocities like who tends to work or sleep at the same time.
							<br><br>And this is a good design choice to finish the story with, to invite the viewer to compare their own daily rhythm to these creative people.

							Since Power BI is a desktop product and has different protocols for data collection and retention than Microsoft Research, we don't know as much about how people use it unless they contact us directly.
							<br><br>
							However, we do know that by the end of 2018, the Timeline Storyteller component for Power BI had been downloaded over 36,000 times.

							I'll step back now to mention that this timeline work is just one area in the much larger expressive information design landscape, as Timeline Storyteller is just one of the design tools for non-programmers that has emerged from our group over the past couple of years. 
							<br><br>
							These include: 
							<br><br>
							ChartAccent, which is a tool for annotating charts via direct manipulation, one that was motivated by current chart annotation practices by major news outlets
							<br><br>
							DataToon, which will appear at CHI this year, which is a pen + touch tool for drawing comics about dynamic network data
							<br><br>
							And Charticulator, which is an incredibly flexible tool for creating reusable bespoke chart templates with various layout options, and this one received an honorable mention at InfoVis last year and was shortlisted for the Information is Beautiful Awards.

							I've touched upon the evaluation of Timeline Storyteller as an expressive information design tool, but  how do we evaluate the quality of the data-driven stories that it creates? 
							<br><br>
							Or how do we evaluate data-driven stories more generally?  
							<br><br>
							A story that makes use of visualization, text, and potentially interaction may incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it good?
							<br><br>
							These questions led to a discussion that culminated in a book chapter that I contributed to in last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book, where my co-authors included a journalist and an information designer.

							<br><br>
							Both years, I asked a panel of visualization practitioners to judge stories about data submitted by students.   
							<br><br>
							Many of the entries included highly expressive visualization design choices, but essentially they were custom dashboards that told no story, or they expected the viewer to infer the story.

							We recruited 100 participants from Mechanical Turk's U.S. crowd worker population, split evenly into a temperature range group and a sleep range group, though we excluded results from 13 participants, due to non-completion, non-compliance, or for failing to correctly respond to quality control trials distributed throughout the experiment
							<br><br>
							They had to use a mobile phone running a recent version of iOS or Android.

							We calculated ratios in completion time and differences in error rate between the two layouts and between the 3 levels of granularity.

						<aside class="notes">
							The difficulty in reading range values for indicated dates may be due to the fact that the quantitative domain in a radial layout is compressed to half of the chart area, from the center to the periphery, thus putting it at a disadvantage relative to a linear layout, where the quantitative domain spans the entire height of the chart, so individual marks are twice as tall. 
							<br><br>
							We kept the chart size constant between the two layout conditions, but it would be interesting to repeat our experiment in which mark size is kept constant instead of chart size, meaning that linear range charts would be compressed to half of their current height.

							So you might be wondering if our results cast doubt on radial layouts in general, this despite their popularity in practice and design communities. 
							<br><br>
							It's tempting to say this but our results are somewhat more nuanced. <br><br>
							Yes, people tend to be slower with radial layouts, but only in value reading task contexts are they less accurate, while there seems to be no difference in accuracy for comparison tasks. <br><br>
							However, it's also worth remarking that participants universally preferred linear layouts, and they felt more confident using linear layouts relative to radial ones.

							One interpretation of our results is that a month may not be an appropriate granularity for either temperature ranges or sleep ranges, since temperatures follow an annual cycle, not a monthly one, and we tend to have a weekly sleep routine across weekdays and weekends, as opposed to a monthly sleep routine. 
							<br><br>
							What's interesting here is that many health and sleep tracking apps have a month or 4-week time window setting.
