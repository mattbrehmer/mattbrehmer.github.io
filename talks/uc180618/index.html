					<aside class="notes">
							In 2015, I became somewhat obsessed with timelines, collecting and cataloguing hundreds of diagrams and techniques that visually communicate sequences of events. This inspired me to develop a visualization sandbox for rapidly generating alternative timeline designs during an internship at Microsoft Research. In parallel to this, my colleagues and I produced a timeline design space along with a set of related guidelines for narrative visualization  . In this talk, I will present what has happened since we wrote a paper about our design space and survey. Upon returning to Microsoft Research, I revisited my sandbox project and developed Timeline Storyteller, an open-source authoring tool for presenting visually expressive timeline-based stories. Following its release as a prototype web application in early 2017, I worked with the MSR Special Projects team to release Timeline Storyteller as a component for Microsoft Power BI, an established business intelligence tool with a large worldwide user community. I will speak about the use of Timeline Storyteller in large public presentations, the results of a storytelling contest that we held for members of the Power BI community, and observations regarding a corpus of user-generated content. Finally, I will reflect upon our methodology for studying the usage and adoption of Timeline Storyteller and more generally what researchers and practitioners can do to evaluate deployed visualization authoring tools.

							<span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you're seeing here are two timelines, Furyk's is on top, Johnson's on the bottom, indicating the results of every U.S. Open appearance in their respective careers.
							<br><br>With red indicating a victory, gold indicating a finishing placement, and grey indicating that they were cut from the tournament after the first 36 holes.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: You can see that Furyk has appeared at the U.S. Open for longer than Johnson, and that they both have only one victory to date under their belt.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: In comparison, golf legend Ben Hogan appeared many times over the course of 4 decades, and he won an impressive four times during a six year span in the late 1940s / early 1950s.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Johnson and Furyk never played with Hogan, they were born at different times, and it's a bit unfair to compare a mid-career golfer and an early-career golfer to a legend like Hogan.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: But by changing the scale to one that is relative to their births, we can see if Johnson or Furyk are on track to follow in Hogan's footsteps. 
							<br><br>we can also see that Johnson and Furyk were about the same age when they won the U.S Open. 
							<br><br>Hogan was older during his winning streak, but perhaps he would have won earlier during the gap in his early 30s, which corresponds to World War II and years that the tournament was cancelled.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Or we can remove relative chronology altogether and keep just the sequence of their U.S. Open appearances, where we learn that, coincidentally, all 3 golfers won in their 9th appearance.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: And finally I can introduce you to another legend, Jack Nicklaus, who appeared more than 40 times, and his 4 victories were more spaced out than Hogan's.

						<aside class="notes">
							As a second example that ties all of this together, I'm going to present a story about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and the like.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: A good starting point is to ask: when do creative people create? Are people similar in this regard?
							<br><br>It looks as though some people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have people like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: We can also ask about the relationship between sleep and creativity: how much? how often? and when do creative people sleep?
							<br><br>Most people in this dataset sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>What about variation and creativity? How often should you change activities if you want to be creative?
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This chronological scale isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so let's transition to a sequential scale. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To determine who varied the most and least, a linear representation is perhaps best, where we can easily see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people in this dataset, 
							<br><br>while Murakami prefers less variation.

								At one end of the storytelling spectrum, there's presenting an interactive choose-your-own adventure timeline, and there are quite a few tools out there that present timelines in this way, like this one called Timeglider. But these open-ended exploratory tools don’t guarantee that your story was communicated to the viewer; they are fine for open-ended data analysis, and there are certainly quite a few data analysis tools that look like this, but these tools don't guide the attention of the viewer along a narrative.						</aside>
