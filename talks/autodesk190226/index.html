						<aside class="notes">
						In terms of how I do my research, 
						<br><br>						
						I spend a lot of time designing and building things  
						<br><br>
						I've alternated between visualization and interface design at various levels of fidelity, 
						<br><br>
						as well as software development for a deployed product, a research toolkit, and various visualization tools and experimental applications. 
						<br><br>
						Though just as important are the human-centred research methods that I use,
						<br><br>
						This includes quite a bit of qualitative evaluation work during my PhD in the context of visualization design or case studies,
						<br><br>
						Which involved everything from requirements analysis to analyzing the usage of deployed visualization tools.
						<br><br>
						This qualitative work also involves systematically collecting and categorized previous research as well as information design content done by practitioners.
						<br><br>
						And finally I also do lab-based experimental work, and especially recently with some experiments involving crowdsourcing,
						<br><br>
						I'll revisit some of these methods later in this talk when I speak about evaluating interactive visualization tools.

						<aside class="notes">
						With respect to the values and goals that underlie my research,
						<br><br>
						I'm really hoping to advance the democratization of information design and data visualization: 
						<br><br>						
						And this means enabling more people to visualize and present compelling stories about their data, 
						<br><br>
						And its in this respect that I contrast my research from that of many others in the broader visualization community, such as those working in visual analytics. 
						<br><br>
						Many in the visualization and visual analytics research community are motivated by use cases from professional data analysis, data science, or business intelligence. 
						<br><br> 
						While I think these use cases are important and I'm glad that people are thinking about them, they are <em>NOT</em> the use cases that motivate my research. 
						<br><br>
						Instead, I'm interested in incorporating visualization to present information to people who don't identify as data analysts, in both public and personal contexts.
						<br><br>
						This leads me to ask questions like ``why are journalists and educators are using business intelligence tools to present information to their audiences``?
						<br><br>
						And I wonder if I build better tools for these communities and the needs that they have

						Another thing that drives my work is connecting visualization researchers and practitioners.

						<br><br>
						And collecting examples of information design produced by practitioners.
						<br><br> 
						And finally this means speaking directly with practitioners and presenting my work at conferences like OpenVisConf,which is one of the most renowned practitioner-oriented visualization events, 
						<br><br>
						Or how I co-organized the VisInPractice event at last year's IEEE VIS conference, where I invited prominent visualization practitioners to speak to a largely academic audience.

						Characterizing these design spaces becomes particularly important when you decide to expose them to an author in the form of an information design tool, where there is a question about the level of granularity:

						For example, as a designer are you controlling low-level visual encoding channels like shape or color, or are you picking a chart type from a template?

							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							One of these constraints is expertise:

							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Another constraint is about resources:

							<br><br>							
							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							Yet another constraint is literacy: 
							<br><br>						
							What if my audience lacks the sufficient visual literacy or data literacy needed to interpret my particular choice of visual representation? 
							<br><br>
							How can I make use of their prior knowledge as part of the communication process?

							<span style="color:crimson"><< CLICK >></span> 
							And finally there's the device: what if my audience is consuming this information from a mobile device?

							How does that constrain my choices?

							To illustrate this, I want to tell you a few interesting things about the daily routines of famous creative people.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">MAX</span>: What you see here is a set of radial timelines depicting a typical 24 hours in the lives of 26 writers, artists, composers, and other creative types.
							<br><br>When they work, eat, sleep, exercise, and do other activities. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had wondered if there was any pattern as to when creative people do their  creative work.
							<br><br>It turns out that at least among these people, some creative people prefer to work in short, focused bursts, like Darwin or Kant, while people like Murakami and Voltaire get up early and work for long uninterrupted periods of time. 
							<br><br>Meanwhile, you have odd ones like Kafka who work all night long. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: I had also wondered about the potential relationship between sleep and creativity, so let me focus your attention to these blue arcs.
							<br><br>Most people here tend to sleep at night, with notable exceptions like Balzac who would turn in at 6pm, and Kafka, who just seemed to keep odd hours.
							<br><br>A third question I had was about variation and creativity. Let me show you how often these creative people change activities throughout their day.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: This 24-hour clock metaphoe isn't the best way to convey the number or heterogeneity of activities, so I'm going to transition to a just show you a sequence of activities without any duration, effectively resulting in a radial bar chart. 
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: To show who varied the most and least among these people, a linear representation is probably better, where you can see that Darwin has the most varied day of all the people here while Murakami prefers less variation.
							<br><br><span style="color:red">NEXT</span>: Finally, I'll restore the duration of events so that you can compare these timelines just by scanning up and down, where you might spot times where some routines appear to be in sync with one another, such as when people work or sleep at the same time.
							<br><br>And this is a good time to ask you to compare your own daily rhythm to these creative people.
							<br><br>When do you sleep, eat, or do you best creative work?

							In late 2014, I became fascinated by the potential for expressive information design with timelines,

							<br><br> 
							I began collecting and systematically categorizing how people have drawn timelines over the course of history.
							<br><br> 
							I did so upon realizing that prior visualization research involving timelines had focused on their uses in data analysis, such as for understanding patterns in electronic health records.

								Provide <strong>alternative</strong> time <strong>scales</strong>.<br><br>
								Anticipate <strong>chronological</strong> or <strong>non-chronological</strong> narratives.<br><br>
								Incrementally <strong>reveal</strong> visual elements, selectively <strong>highlighting</strong> and <strong>annotating</strong> to direct attention.
							</small>

						<aside class="notes">
							In this TVCG paper I make the case that timeline design tools should provide alternative representations of time and alternative time scales.
							<br><br>
							I should also emphasize that existing timeline tools also tend towards a chronological narrative: 
							<br><br>
							Either the whole timeline is shown as a static image, so readers are likely to begin at the start of the timeline, or events are revealed in chronological order, one event at a time as a series of slides.  
							<br><br>
							For some stories, a chronological introduction of events makes total sense, while for others it does not,
							<br><br>
							Like how in my story about the routines of creative people, I revealed and highlighted aspects of those timelines in an order that wasn't chronological starting at midnight. 
							<br><br>
							To achieve this expressive narrative design, you should make use of animation, highlighting, and annotation to incrementally reveal parts of a narrative (that may not be chronological), to allow the viewer to make new comparisons.

						<hr>		

						<small style="text-align: left">
							<strong>No prior interactive tools</strong> for presenting <strong>expressive timeline narratives</strong>.
							<br><br>
							The <strong></strong>first</strong> to incorporate multi-scene stories with <strong>multiple visual representation choices</strong>.
							<br><br>
							Incrementally <strong>reveal</strong> + <strong>transform</strong>; selectively <strong>highlight</strong> + <strong>annotate</strong>; applicable to other data types</strong>.
							<br><br><br><br>
							<strong>Recommend design choices</strong> and <strong>annotations</strong> based on properties of the dataset.
						</small>							

						<aside class="notes">
							In summary, Timeline Storyteller fills a gap in that no existing tool allows a non-programmer to present a visually expressive timeline narrative.
							<br><br>
							It's really the first to incorporate this animated multi-scene PowerPoint-like story format along with multiple visual representation choices;
							<br><br>
							And I believe that many aspects of its design can be applied to other forms of data, such as its ability to incrementally reveal and selectively highlight content.
							<br><br>
							We're still learning about how it's being used in the wild, 
							<br><br>
							As our limited evaluation of content analysis and usage only revealed so much.
							<br><br>
							And while the content produced does reflect our timeline design space to an extent,
							<br><br>   
							Seeing this content made me realize the opportunity for providing overt recommendations of design choices, captions, and annotations more overtly within the application based on properties of the dataset, such as the temporal extent and distribution of the events.

							The process of looking at the content produced with Timeline Storyteller and other tools also makes me wonder about

							How the visualization community should evaluate data-driven stories more generally.
							<br><br>
							Consider a story that makes use of visualization, annotation, text, and potentially interaction.

							It might incorporate many design choices, in that the author was highly expressive; but was it any good?
							<br><br>
							So in book chapter that I wrote for last year's Data-Driven Storytelling book,
							<br><br>
							My co-authors and I attempted to catalog all the ways you might evaluate this form of content.

						The specific project that I'll focus on now is one that I presented a few months ago at VIS,
						<br><br>
						And its origins came during demonstrations of Timeline Storyteller to a group at Microsoft designing personal health apps. 
						<br><br>
						They asked me "will this work on mobile?", since they were designing mobile apps involving time-oriented personal activity data, namely sleep data. 
						<br><br>
						Like with the timeline project, I started this one by looking to current practice and how designers currently visualize data on mobile phones.

						<aside class="notes">							
							First, I've continued my crowdsourced experimental research and made use of the same experimental application framework and protocol from the ranges work, 
							<br><br>
							For another experiment that compared two design alternatives for trend visualization on mobile phones, 
							<br><br>
							Which was inspired by the rise of looped animated news graphics that you might encounter on social media, 
							<br><br>
							If you're interested in the results of this study, 
							<br><br>
							I have a working paper that I'll be submitting to VIS this year which I can send you.

							<strong><span style="color:cornflowerblue"><em>Discoverable Interactions for Navigating & Selecting Time-Varying Data on Mobile Phones</em></span></strong>. <br><span style="font-weight: 700">Brehmer</span>, Lee, Collins, and Hinckley.

							<!-- <img width="90%" data-src="../assets/tilt.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none"></img> -->
							<strong>Motivation</strong>: few people interact with interactive news graphics beyond scrolling.
							<br><br>
							Many interactions anticipate a desktop context, but most of the audience is <strong>using a mobile device</strong>. 
							<br><br>
							UI elements for navigating multidimensional time-varying data occupy <strong>too much screen real estate</strong>.							
							<br><br>

						</small>
	
						<aside class="notes">							
						Meanwhile, I've also been developing novel techniques for interacting with representations of time-varying data on mobile phones.
						<br><br>
						Which is motivated by statements from news organizations that few people interact with their news graphics aside from scrolling, 
						<br><br>
						Despite the presence of additional interactivity.
						<br><br>
						So in this project I've been assessing alternative interaction techniques that aim to be discoverable while conserving precious screen real estate.
