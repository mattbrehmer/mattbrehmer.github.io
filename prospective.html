					<hr>

					<p>
						Thank you for your interest in working with me!
					</p>

					<p>––</p>
					
					<p>
						I joined the faculty of the <strong><a rel="me" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/contacts/matthew-brehmer" target="_blank" alt="substack" title="uwaterloo">David. R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo</a></strong> in Fall 2024. I'm looking to recruit undergraduate and graduate research assistants to start in 2025. Before you contact me at mbrehmer [at] uwaterloo.ca, please read the following instructions, otherwise you'll be unlikely to get a response. Similarly, do not make a meeting request with me until I've directed you to do so.
					</p>

					<p>––</p>

					<p>
						Construct your subject line as follows: <br><br><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">"Interest in joining your research team: { NAME } { LEVEL }"</span><br><br> where <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">NAME</span> includes your family and given names, while <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">LEVEL</span> is your sought after level of supervision: <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">undergrad | MMath | PhD | postdoc</span>. 
					</p>

					<p>––</p>

					<p>
						1. Begin your email with "Hi Matt!". This will assure me that you've already read this far :)
					</p>

					<p></p>

					<p>
						2. In a sentence or two, tell me which <strong><a href="https://mattbrehmer.ca/" target="_blank">recent project</a></strong> / <strong><a href="https://mattbrehmer.ca#pubs" target="_blank">paper</a></strong> of mine resonates most with you.
					</p>	

					<p></p>

					<p>
						3. Which of these three topics are you most interested in?: <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">{ bite-sized data storytelling | spatial computing + augmented reality (AR) experiences for synchronous communication and collaboration around information | immersive data analogies}</span>. Explain why or what the topic means to you in a sentence or two.
					</p>

					<p></p>

					<p>
						4. Include other pertinent details, but please keep it to two to three sentences. Examples include links to your project portfolio, YouTube channel, LinkedIn profile, or writing samples. 
					</p>

					<p>––</p>

					<p>
						If you follow these instructions, there's a good chance that I'll reply. 
					</p>

						<strong>Graduate-level applicants</strong>:
					</p>

					<p>
						Here is the <strong><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/future-graduate-students/applying-admissions" target="_blank" title="application link">application link</a></strong>. Please make sure to indicate that you want to work with me on your application, as this increases the odds that I will see your full application package. Once the graduate admissions committee does a preliminary review of applications, I expect to review those indicating an interest in my areas of human-computer interaction (HCI) research between December and January. At this time, I will schedule interviews with applicants. Until then, please refer to these <strong><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/future-graduate-students/applying-admissions/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" title="application faq">frequently asked questions</a></strong> about the application process.
					</p>

					<p>
						There are several ways that you can work with me. If you are currently a University of Waterloo Computer Science undegraduate student, there are part-time paid opportunities to work with me through the <strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/current-undergraduate-students/research-opportunities/ura#projects" target="_blank" title="ura">Undergraduate Research Assistant (URA) program</a></strong>. You can also do complete an (unpaid) <strong><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/cDescr/CS499T" target="_blank" title="499">CS 499T honours thesis project</a></strong> with me.
